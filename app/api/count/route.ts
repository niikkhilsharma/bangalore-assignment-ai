    Guidelines:
    - 25 questions should assess Predictive Index (PI): behavioral traits, cognitive abilities, and job fit.
    - 25 questions should assess Emotional Intelligence (EQ): self-awareness, relationship management, and empathy.
		- Use various formats: multiple-choice, situational judgment, true/false, scenario-based, and open-ended (input_text).
		- For "input_text" questions, do NOT include "options".
    - Tailor questions to real-world workplace challenges.
    - Base follow-up questions on these candidate responses: ${JSON.stringify(answers)
					.replaceAll('{', '')
					.replaceAll('}', '')}
    
		Example input_text question:
		{{
		  "id": 10,
		  "question": "Describe a time when you had to manage a difficult workplace situation.",
		  "type": "input_text",
		  "placeholder": "Write your response here...",
		  "category": "emotional_intelligence"
		}}
				
		Provide questions formatted as a JSON array, following this schema:
		{{
		  "id": number,
		  "question": string,
		  "type": "multiple_choice" | "input_text",
		  "options": [string, string, string, string] (optional, only for multiple_choice),

		### **Instructions:**

		 1. **Input Data:**  
   - Gather responses from the information, including:
     - Personal Information
     - Professional Background
     - Assessment Preferences
     - Skills and Interests
     - Responses to PI and EQ questions
		 
		 2. **Analysis Criteria:**  
   Evaluate each candidate based on the following dimensions:
   - **Predictive Index Analysis:**
     - Behavioral Traits: Assess alignment with key traits (e.g., Dominance, Influence, Steadiness, Conscientiousness).
     - Cognitive Abilities: Analyze problem-solving skills and reasoning capabilities.
     - Job Fit: Determine how well the candidate's traits align with the requirements of the desired role.

   - **Emotional Intelligence Analysis:**
     - Self-Awareness: Evaluate responses indicating self-reflection and understanding of personal emotions.
     - Social Skills: Assess ability to manage relationships and navigate social complexities.
     - Empathy: Analyze responses that demonstrate understanding and consideration of others' feelings.

		 3. **Scoring System:**  
   Implement a scoring system for each dimension:
   - Use a scale of 1-5 (1 = Poor, 5 = Excellent) for each trait/skill assessed.
   - Provide an average score for both PI and EQ sections.

	   4. **Result Presentation:**  
   Generate a report that includes:
   - **Candidate Overview:** Basic information and professional background.
   - **Strengths:** Highlight top traits/skills based on analysis.
   - **Areas for Improvement:** Identify specific areas where the candidate can enhance their skills.
   - **Overall Suitability:** A summary statement regarding the candidate's fit for the desired role, supported by data from the analysis.
   - **Recommendations:** Suggestions for further development or training based on identified gaps.

		5. **Visualization:**  
		   Include graphs or charts to visually represent:
		   - Trait distributions (e.g., radar charts for PI traits).
		   - Average scores for PI and EQ dimensions.
		   - Comparison against role requirements (if applicable).

		6. **Feedback Loop:**  
		   Allow candidates to receive feedback based on their results, including:
		   - Personalized insights on their performance.
		   - Resources or training programs that could help them improve in specific areas.

		### **Output Format:**  
		- Present results in a clear, professional report format.
		- Ensure that the language is accessible and constructive.
